## Remediation Priority

1. Address the critical command line injection vulnerability in `server.js` by validating and sanitizing user inputs.
2. Upgrade lodash to the latest version to mitigate multiple prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
3. Upgrade serialize-javascript to resolve the RCE vulnerabilities.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization for user-provided values in file paths and XSS contexts.
5. Review and implement rate limiting for sensitive route handlers in `server.js`.

## Auto-fix Summary

List what `npm audit fix` and `eslint --fix` will resolve automatically:
- **npm audit fix:** lodash (to >= 4.17.12), serialize-javascript (to >= 7.0.3), moment (to >= 2.29.4), express (to >= 4.19.2)
- **eslint --fix:** (list of style issues that will be corrected)
- **Manual fixes required:** Command line injection in `server.js`, path injection and reflected XSS in `server.js`, and missing rate limiting in `server.js`.
